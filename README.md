# Overview
DAP - 3.26.18
This A-Frame (aframe.io) application is being used to show all the planets, and some
relevant information about them in an interactive webpage.

Use your Spaceship of Imagination to travel the Solar System.

Can be seen at: http://mindpw3r.com/vr
Use the arrow keys to fly close to the planets

Updates to look forward to:

1. Floating HUD that displays information about the planet you're viewing
2. Full Solar System View
3. Adding Major Moons (probably 6 max) for each planet
4. Working towards scaling the planetary objects correctly (relative to each other)
5. Smoother transitions when navigating between objects
6. Importing actual 3D objects into A-Frame (rather than just using default Spheres)
7. Accuracy of Planetary Axis
8. Accuracy of all Moons orbits/distances/etc
9. Various bug fixes, including fixing the ability to fly "into" the objects
10. Correct the image overlay of Saturn's rings, and apply to both sides of the object

Any suggestions?
